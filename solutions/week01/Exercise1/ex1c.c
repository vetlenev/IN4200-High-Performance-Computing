/*
Note:
This program isn't strictly part of the exercises, but it shows two things: one, how to make a
contigious 2d array, which I hope helps in understanding the much more difficult task
of creating a contigious 3d array (ex1d); second, it demonstrates that it indeed matters
whether one traverses the resulting matrix rowwise or columnwise.

Finally, since the program is timed, I thought this would be a good place to show off
the compiler's optimisation feature. Compile with

> make ex1c_optimised

then run the resulting ex1c_optimised to see how the compiler can rewrite your
code for a bit of speedup.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose of program: test whether traversing a 2d array column by column is as
fast as traversing row by row.

The answer, by the way, should be no. Can you think why?
